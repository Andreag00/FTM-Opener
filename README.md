# FTM-Opener
iOS Shortcut that opens Apple's FTMInternal-4 (FieldTest) when added to the Home Screen

The shortcut opens Apple's FieldTest, which shows all the data related to cell service, but only when added to the Home Screen. Its compatibility has been tested up to iOS 15.4.

Works great in conjuction with my other shortcut available at [Andreag00/ShorteNB](https://github.com/Andreag00/ShorteNB)

# How to import into Shortcuts

To download the shortcut, simply download the .shortcut file or open the link in the "link" file.
